       <p>I moved to Mallorca in the fall of 2016 and spent a year teaching abroad. It was by far the most beautiful place I will ever live. 
           There were mountains to hike and beaches to explore. The pueblos were amazing.

       <p> I decided to move to Madrid and continue teaching in an attempt to improve my spanish.
            In Mallorca they spoke Mallorquin which was a dialect of Catalan. I was able to greatly improve my spanish and
            spent 3 years in Madrid loving every second of it!
