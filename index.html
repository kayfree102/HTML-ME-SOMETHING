        <img src="https://www.muskincommercial.com/sites/default/files/blog/featured/austin-skyline-changes.jpg" alt="Austin, Texas">
        <p>I moved to Austin Texas in 2012 to study Psychology at the University of Texas. Hook 'Em!
        </p>

        <h2>Sydney, Australia</h2>

        <p>UT had a student swap program that allowed me to study abroad at the University of New South Wales for the spring semester of 2015.
             Truly one of the coolest experiences of my life! 
        </p>


       <h3>Palma, Mallorca</h3>

       <p> A friend from Australia told me about a free teaching program through the Spanish Ministry. In 2016 I moved to Mallorca and spent a year teaching abroad. It was by far the most beautiful place I will ever live. 
           Every weekend there were new mountains to hike and beaches to explore. Truly an amazing year on an amazing island.

       <h4> Madrid, Spain</h4>
       <img src="https://www.iesabroad.org/files/blog/images/mparrot%40umich.edu/2019-08-25/madridpic_0.jpg" alt="Madrid">
       <p> I decided to move to Madrid and continue teaching in an attempt to improve my Spanish.
            In Mallorca they spoke Mallorquin which was a dialect of Catalan. I was able to greatly improve my Spanish in Madrid and
            ended up spending 3 more years in Spain!

        <h5>St. Louis</h5>

        <p>This fall, I moved back to St. Louis to complete a coding course through Launch Code. It has been great to spend time with my family and especially spend the holidays at home.
